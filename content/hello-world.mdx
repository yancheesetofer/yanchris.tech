Hi there! 👋

tips to Get Started

Define clear boundaries: Set guardrails so your agent never oversteps on sensitive tasks.
Start small: automate one tiny daily chore (e.g., sending your hourly hydration reminder).
iterate: Watch how it performs, give feedback, adjust prompts and parameters....
Share your configs: Join the community repos—many folks publish their “agentic recipes” on GitHub.
what next?

The field is exploding right now. Researchers are:

Exploring multi-agent systems where agents collaborate :-)
Adding emotional intelligence so agents can detect your stress and offer empathy.
Building visual planning interfaces so you can drag-and-drop your agent’s workflow.
I, for one, can’t wait to see my agent recommend the perfect Spotify playlist when I hit that afternoon slump. 🎧

Over to You!

```jsx
agenticAI.run(
  "Plan my day, book my meeting rooms, and remind me to stretch every hour."
);
```
