## Overview

in this document, I'll walk you through the development of the Jargonator library, a Go-based HTTP server that translates between plain English and exaggerated corporate jargon using OpenAI's API. While the functionality may seem straightforward, the design decisions and architecture show how to build a reusable, maintainable library that other developers can easily integrate into their apps

(disclaimer: this project is solely built for my http server learning purpose only)

## Business Context

Corporate communication (at least from my experience) often suffers from:

- Excessive jargon that obscures simple ideas
- Unnecessarily complex language that reduces clarity
- Verbosity that wastes time and reduces engagement

Simultaneously, plain language can sometimes lack the authoritative tone expected in business settings.

**Goal**: Build a library that provides a humorous yet practical API for translating between plain English and corporate jargon, allowing developers to integrate this functionality into their own applications, chatbots, or tools.

## Technical Architecture

I've adopted a modular, interface-driven design that follows Clean Architecture principles for several reasons:

### Separation of Concerns

each component in the library has a single responsibility:

- **OpenAI Client**: interfaces with the OpenAI API
- **Prompter**: Constructs specialized prompts for translations
- **Translation Service**: Orchestrates between Prompter and OpenAI Client
- **HTTP Handlers**: manages HTTP input/output
- **Server**: Ties everything together with configuration

this clear separation makes the code easier to understand, test, and extend (hopefully)

### Technical Decision: Interface-Based Design

**Pros:**
- compponents can be mocked easily for testing
- implementation details can change without affecting dependent components
- Users can provide custom implementations for specific needs
- Clean dependency direction from outer layers to inner layers

**Cons:**
- Introduce more abstraction than might be needed for simple use cases
- more verbose code with interfaces and implementations
- can be over-engineered for small applications
- May create a minor learning curve for new developers like myself

I chose this approach because the benefits of testability and extensibility outweighed the costs of additional abstractions, especially given the need for mocking the OpenAI API during development and testing.

### Folder Structure

```
jargonatorlib/
├── config.go           # Configuration struct and validation
├── jargonator.go       # Main library entry points (Server struct, Start/Shutdown)
├── handlers/
│   └── translate.go    # HTTP handlers for /to-jargon and /to-plain
├── translation/
│   ├── service.go      # Core translation logic
│   ├── prompter.go     # Prompt generation for OpenAI
│   ├── openai_api.go   # OpenAI API implementation
│   └── openai_client.go # OpenAI client with validation
└── examples/
    └── simple-server/   # Example server implementation
```

## Code Overview

### Configuration (Config)

```go
type Config struct {
    Port                  string
    OpenAIAPIKey          string
    OpenAIModel           string
    RequestTimeoutSeconds int
}
```

### Technical Decision: Configuration Struct with Validation

**Pros:**
- centralize all configuration in one place
- Validates configuration early to fail fast
- type safety compared to environment variables

**Cons:**
- More structured than simple environment variables
- requires more code than direct access to environment
- again, another layer for simple configurations
- Requires validation maintenance when adding fields

I chose this approach for its robustness and type safety, especially when handling critical configuration like API keys and timeouts.

### Server Component

```go
type Server struct {
    config     Config
    httpServer *http.Server
}

func NewServer(cfg Config) (*Server, error)
func (s *Server) Start() error
func (s *Server) Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
```

### Technical Decision: Using Standard http.Server

**Pros:**
- Leverages Go's standard library
- Well understood by Go developers
- No external dependencies
- Provides graceful shutdown capabilities

**Cons:**
- less feature rich than frameworks like Gin
- Requires more boilerplate for advanced features
- Manual routing setup
- No built-in middleware system

### Translation Service

```go
type Service struct {
    client   OpenAIClient
    prompter PrompterInterface
    model    string
}

func (s *Service) TranslateToJargon(text string) (string, error)
func (s *Service) TranslateToPlain(text string) (string, error)
```

### Technical Decision: Specialized Prompter Component

**Pros:**
- Separates prompt engineering from API interaction
- Allows prompt refinement without changing other components
- Makes the translation "personality" configurable
- Isolates the creative aspect of the system

**Cons:**
- Additional abstraction for a relatively simple operation
- could be considered overengineering for basic prompting
- Requires maintenance of prompt templates

The Prompter component was deemed essential because the quality of the translations depends heavily on well-crafted prompts, and this design allows prompt improvements without affecting the rest of the system.

### OpenAI Client

```go
type OpenAIClientImpl struct {
    api OpenAIAPI
}

func (c *OpenAIClientImpl) GetCompletion(prompt string, model string) (string, error)
```

### Technical Decision: Official OpenAI Client vs. Custom Implementation

**Pros of Official Client:**
- maintaned by OpenAI and its commmunity
- Automatic updates for API changes
- Proper error handling
- Type safety for requests/responses

**Cons of Official Client:**
- Additional dependency
- Version compatibility concerns

I chose the official OpenAI client for its reliability, maintenance, and proper handling of things.


## Running the Project

### Build
```bash
go build -o jargon-server ./examples/simple-server
```

### Run Example Server
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
./jargon-server
```

### Test
```bash
go test ./...
```

## Conclusion

The Jargonator lib demonstrates how even a simple functionality can benefit from thoughtful architecture. by following clean architecture principles, using interface-based design, and employing TDD, we've created a maintainable library that:

1. is thoroughly tested at all levels
2. Can be easily extended or modified
3. Separates concerns for better maintainability

the project successfully fulfills its goal of providing a humorous yet practical tool for translating between plain English and corporate jargon, packaged as a library that other developers can easily integrate into their app.
